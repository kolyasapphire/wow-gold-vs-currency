# World of Warcraft Gold vs. Fiat Currency

A backend which fetches the current gold value of [WoW Token](https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/world-of-warcraft-token) and checks how it compares to conversion rate of various fiat currencies.

Used in [wow-gold-vs-currency-ui](https://github.com/kolyasapphire/wow-gold-vs-currency-ui).
